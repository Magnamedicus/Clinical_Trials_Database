# Clinical_Trials_Database
A prototype SQL Database creation-script for a database intended to keep track of clinical trials, clinical coordinators, physicians, studies and study participants. No private or HIPAA protected information exists in this script.

This script was meant as a mockup for a proposed database to assist with keeping more organized records at my job as a clinical research coordinator in an oncology clinical trials office. The database is in Boyce-Codd normal form.
